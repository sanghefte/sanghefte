			<h1>Happy New Year</h1>
			<p>
				No more champagne<br />
				And the fireworks are through<br />
				Here we are, me and you<br />
				Feeling lost and feeling blue<br />
				It's the end of the party<br />
				And the morning seems so grey<br />
				So unlike yesterday<br />
				Now's the time for us to say
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Refreng:</i>
				<br />
				Happy New Year<br />
				Happy New Year<br />
				May we all have a vision now and then<br />
				Of a world where every neighbor is a friend<br />
				Happy New Year<br />
				Happy New Year<br />
				May we all have our hopes, our will to try<br />
				If we don't we might as well lay down and die<br />
				You and I<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes I see<br />
				How the brave new world arrives<br />
				And I see how it thrives<br />
				In the ashes of our lives<br />
				Oh yes, man is a fool<br />
				And he thinks he'll be okay<br />
				Dragging on, feet of clay<br />
				Never knowing he's astray<br />
				Keeps on going anyway
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Refreng..</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Seems to me now<br />
				That the dreams we had before<br />
				Are all dead, nothing more<br />
				Than confetti on the floor<br />
				It's the end of a decade<br />
				In another ten years time<br />
				Who can say what we'll find<br />
				What lies waiting down the line<br />
				In the end of eighty-nine
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Refreng..</i>
			</p>
		</div>
